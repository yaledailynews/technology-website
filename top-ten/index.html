                                </div>
                                <div class="timeline-body">
                                    <p class="text-muted">In 2014, the issue of sexual assault — and its grip on college campuses — has come to the fore. At Yale, major changes to disciplinary procedure, coupled with the development of peer-to-peer training, has followed from the U.S. Department of Education’s Title IX investigation into the University’s sexual climate, concluded in June 2012. A White House mandate further moved dialogue, leading student groups to declare that the issue of sexual assault is “on us,” or the campus’ collective concern.</p></br>
                                     <p class="text-muted">An in-depth examination of one case adjudicated by the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct revealed how Yale tries rape claims. Earlier in November, that process was thrown into question by concerns over Provost Benjamin Polak’s decision to reduce the UWC’s punishment for Michael Simons, the cardiology chief reprimanded for sexual harassment. Unease about the status of women at the medical school paralleled concerns at the School of Management, which came to light after professor Constance Bagley filed suit against the University, alleging gender and age discrimination.</p></br>
                                       <p class="text-muted">And in December, before a packed audience in Woolsey Hall, former President Jimmy Carter chided University President Peter Salovey for not handing down stricter punishments for rapists.</p>

                                </div>
                                <div class="timeline-body">
                                    <p class="text-muted">In early October, the global Ebola scare inched closer to New Haven and the University after reports that two Yale graduate students returning from Liberia were to sequester themselves. But when Yale-New Haven Hospital admitted one of the two students for Ebola-like symptoms in mid-October, the University’s response and the city’s preparedness to handle the epidemic were called into question — even after the student was ultimately found not to have Ebola.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class="text-muted">Prior to his hospitalization, the student, revealed to be Ryan Boyko GRD ’18, had ultimately not been placed in a quarantine, a measure that medical and public health professionals deemed unnecessary at the time. Following the scare, however, he and his colleague were quarantined as a precaution. Later, The New York Times reported that a third Yale student had been placed under quarantine, though the University maintained that only two students were being quarantined. Throughout his sequestration and after his release, Boyko remained critical of the decision. There have been no documented cases of Ebola in New Haven.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">In 2017, Yale College will welcome 800 new students to two new residential colleges, which remain unnamed. Construction has already begun on the triangular plot where the new facilities will sit, just south of Ingalls Rink. Fundraising was completed for the project at the beginning of the summer.</p>
                                    <br><p class="text-muted">
                                    Still, major work remains in preparing the College for the expansion, the largest transformation of the undergraduate student body since coeducation. Committees composed of students, faculty, alumni and staff have begun to tackle this challenge, but their mandate remains hazy.

                                    <p class="text-muted">As fiscal 2013 gave way to fiscal 2014, a $51 million surplus replaced a $39 million deficit. Yet budget cuts continued, even as the endowment rose to an all-time high. Labor relations frayed as a result.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class="text-muted">A flashpoint was the centralization of dining services under the Culinary Support Center. Employees at the new center, located on Winchester Avenue, have raised safety concerns about the manner of their work. In September, Local 35, the blue-collar union representing dining workers, filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging Yale had breached its contract in restructuring Yale Dining.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Tensions also mounted between the University and Yale Security, which formed the independent Yale University Security Officers Association on Oct. 17, despite divisiveness within the department. But after firing three employees in November, the University faces questions about its willingness to work with the new, smaller union.</p><br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Meanwhile, the University has paid little heed to graduate students attempting to form a union. The University announced in December it would fund a sixth year of graduate study for students in the humanities and social sciences.

                                    <p class="text-muted">After welcoming a new president and provost in 2013, Yale faced still more turnover in its highest ranks this summer with three new deans, one in a role with no precedent: Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, assumed by Tamar Gendler. Jonathan Holloway took the helm of the College and Lynn Cooley the Graduate School, replacing Mary Miller and Thomas Pollard, respectively. Along with a dean, so, too, does the FAS now have a senate. In December, faculty approved bylaws for the new body, whose first meeting is slated for fall of 2015.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Meanwhile, as Peter Salovey has settled into his role as Yale’s 23rd president, the cabinet of administrators advising him will soon shift, as stalwarts of the Richard Levin era begin to depart. Most notable, perhaps, is the planned exit of Linda Lorimer, a longtime vice president with a major hand in Yale’s initiatives online, abroad and right in the University's backyard, in the city of New Haven.

                                    <p class="text-muted">In retrospect, University President Peter Salovey’s discussion of free speech in this year’s freshman address foreshadowed some of the semester’s most controversial events.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>First, former Episcopal Chaplain Bruce Shipman penned a controversial letter to the editor of The New York Times discussing ties between anti-semitism in Europe to ongoing strife in Israel and Palestine. Individuals within the University and beyond accused Shipman of anti-semitism, precipitating his resignation.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Shortly after, the Muslim Students Association wrote an open letter criticizing the William F. Buckley Jr. Program for bringing noted anti-Islamist Ayaan Hirsi Ali to campus. The controversy was heightened when several of the 35 student groups co-signing on the letter claimed never to have supported the campaign.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>A month after Hirsi Ali’s appearance, swastikas were found drawn in chalk on Old Campus. They were universally denounced, and students debated the implications of these events on campus free speech and religious life.

                                    <p class="text-muted">The suspension in January of a student-made, online course selection tool set off a debate over data use and entrepreneurialism that encouraged the University to clarify its policies on access to its information systems.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>For three semesters, Yale BlueBook+ had allowed students to compare class evaluations using data from Yale’s Online Course Information system. On Jan. 13, the website was blocked on University servers. Developers and brothers Peter Xu ’14 and Harry Yu ’14 were told that they had made improper use of evaluations and, further, had not been authorized to use the Yale logo.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Less than a week later, Sean Haufler ’14 launched another website designed to replicate the function of YBB+. Written as a Google Chrome extension of Xu and Yu’s creation, the site was met with praise from then-Dean Mary Miller, who called the new site a “good quick fix,” providing identical services without violating Yale’s acceptable use policy. In announcing his site, Haufler indicted the University’s approach, saying IP blocking as a means of censorship was both “unethical” and “futile.” Miller later responded in an open letter, saying “we could have been more patient” in dealing with the student developers.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>CourseTable, a modified version of YBB+, has not been tampered with since.

                                    <p class="text-muted">Student protests were only the most visible sign that something was wrong at Gourmet Heaven, the popular 24-hour grocery store with locations on Broadway and Whitney Avenue.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Owner Chung Cho was arrested in February, facing felony and misdemeanor charges, stemming from numerous counts of wage theft and failure to comply with a state Department of Labor investigation. His arrest came roughly half a year before the University announced plans to terminate the lease on both locations, owned by Yale’s real estate arm, in June 2015. A New Haven Superior Court judge gave Cho accelerated rehabilitation in December, binding him to two years of probation but ensuring he will not serve time in jail for his infractions. Similar allegations of wage theft have emerged at other downtown businesses, leveled by the state against J&B Deli and by employees against the now-shuttered Pinkberry, both on Chapel Street.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>And while the University has not indicated what will replace Gourmet Heaven, high-end retail is sweeping into empty storefronts elsewhere on Broadway.

                                    <p class="text-muted">With stalwart receivers Deon Randall '15 and Grant Wallace '15 returning alongside star running back Tyler Varga '15, expectations for the Yale football team were high going into head coach Tony Reno’s third season. And the Bulldogs did not disappoint.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Varga was named the Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year after recording a school-record 26 touchdowns. New starting quarterback Morgan Roberts '16 set or tied records for passing yards, completion percentage and touchdown passes. The Elis’ overtime thriller against Army — their first win over a school in the Football Bowl Subdivision since 1981 — was just one of several landmark wins throughout the fall.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>After defeating Princeton 44-30, Yale positioned itself to capture the Ivy crown with a win at The Game. With the nation’s eyes on Cambridge, however, Yale lost 31-24 on a last-minute touchdown, finishing the season 8-2.

                                    <p class="text-muted">On the first day of fall classes, the Yale Corporation’s Committee on Investor Responsibility issued its decision not to divest from fossil fuels, rebuffing a growing student movement that urged the University to shift its assets away from environmentally damaging sources of energy. Instead, University President Peter Salovey outlined a series of sustainability initiatives designed to limit Yale’s carbon footprint. Despite these efforts, the University’s greenhouse gas emissions rose in fiscal 2014.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>In October, members of the advocacy group Fossil Free Yale delivered letters to Salovey urging the Corporation to reconsider its decision.
