                                    <p class="text-muted">In 2014, the issue of sexual assault — and its grip on college campuses — has come to the fore. At Yale, major changes to disciplinary procedure, coupled with the development of peer-to-peer training, has followed from the U.S. Department of Education’s <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/11/19/yale-title-ix-complaints-in-line-with-ivy-league/">Title IX</a> investigation into the University’s sexual climate, concluded in June 2012. A <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/06/student-groups-push-to-improve-sexual-climate/">White House mandate</a> further moved dialogue, leading student groups to declare that the issue of sexual assault is <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/02/ycc-forms-sexual-health-task-force/">“on us,”</a> or the campus’ collective concern.</p></br>
                                     <p class="text-muted"><a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/11/07/after-uwc-complaint-two-students-wait/">An in-depth examination of one case</a> adjudicated by the University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct revealed how Yale tries rape claims. Earlier in November, that process was thrown into question by concerns over <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/11/03/polak-overruled-uwc-on-harassment-reprimand-times-reports/">Provost Benjamin Polak’s decided</a> to reduce the <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/11/04/students-criticize-admins-defend-uwc-procedures/">UWC’s punishment</a> for Michael Simons, the cardiology chief reprimanded for sexual harassment. Unease about the status of <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/12/03/at-town-hall-med-school-faculty-criticize-administration/">women at the medical school</a> paralleled concerns at the School of Management, which came to light after professor <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/02/som-professor-sues-university/">Constance Bagley filed suit</a> against the University, alleging gender and age discrimination.</p></br>
                                       <p class="text-muted">And in December, before a packed audience in Woolsey Hall, former <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/02/som-professor-sues-university/">President Jimmy Carter chided University President Peter Salovey</a> for not handing down stricter punishments for rapists.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">In early October, the global Ebola scare inched closer to New Haven and the University after reports that two Yale graduate students returning from Liberia were to <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/02/yale-researchers-to-sequester-themselves-after-return-from-liberia/">sequester themselves</a>. But when Yale-New Haven Hospital admitted one of the two students for Ebola-like symptoms in mid-October, the <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/03/yale-creates-ebola-task-force/">University’s response</a> and the <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/17/ebola-threat-puts-response-plans-in-focus-2/">city’s preparedness</a> to handle the epidemic were called into question — even after the student was ultimately found <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/16/ynhh-admits-patient-with-ebola-like-symptoms/">not to have Ebola.</a></p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class="text-muted">Prior to his hospitalization, the student, revealed to be <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/28/ryan-boyko-one-of-two-quarantined-graduate-students-goes-public/">Ryan Boyko</a> GRD ’18, had ultimately not been placed in a <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/13/ebola-researchers-will-not-sequester-themselves/">quarantine</a>, a measure that medical and public health professionals deemed unnecessary at the time. Following the scare, however, he and his colleague were quarantined as a <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/21/quarantine-continues-for-ebola-researchers/">precaution</a>. Later, The New York Times reported that a third Yale student had been placed under quarantine, though the University <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/27/on-quarantine-administrators-statements-contradict-news-reports/">maintained</a> that only two students were being quarantined. Throughout his sequestration and after his release, Boyko remained <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/31/boyko-released-from-quarantine/">critical</a> of the decision. There have been no documented cases of Ebola in New Haven.</p>

Employees at the new center, located on Winchester Avenue, have raised safety concerns about the manner of their work. In September, Local 35, the blue-collar union representing dining workers, <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/09/18/local-35-files-complaint-against-yale/">filed a complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board alleging Yale had breached its contract in restructuring Yale Dining.</p>

But after <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/12/02/firings-shed-doubt-on-univ-s-treatment-of-security-union/">firing three employees</a> in November, the University faces questions about its willingness to work with the new, smaller union.</p><br>

                                    <p class='text-muted'>First, former Episcopal Chaplain Bruce Shipman penned a <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2014/08/26/episcopal-chaplain-responds-to-backlash/">controversial letter</a> to the editor of The New York Times discussing ties between anti-semitism in Europe to ongoing strife in Israel and Palestine. Individuals within the University and beyond accused Shipman of anti-semitism, precipitating <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/09/09/amidst-controversy-university-reverend-resigns/">his resignation</a>.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Shortly after, the Muslim Students Association wrote an <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/09/10/groups-embroiled-in-controversy-over-speaker/">open letter</a> criticizing the William F. Buckley Jr. Program for bringing noted anti-Islamist <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/09/16/hirsi-ali-addresses-over-300/">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> to campus. The controversy was heightened when several of the 35 student groups co-signing on the letter <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/09/15/after-msa-email-confusion/">claimed never to have supported the campaign</a>.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>A month after Hirsi Ali’s appearance, <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/14/swastikas-chalked-on-old-campus/">swastikas</a> were found drawn in chalk on Old Campus. They were universally denounced, and students debated the implications of these events on campus <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/09/12/lo-the-hypocrisy-of-free-speech/">free speech</a> and <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/08/28/isackson-rev-shipmans-hate/">religious life</a>.

                                    <p class="text-muted">The suspension in January of a student-made, online course selection tool set off a debate over data use and entrepreneurialism that encouraged the University to clarify its policies on access to its information systems.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>For three semesters, Yale BlueBook+ had allowed students to compare class evaluations using data from Yale’s Online Course Information system. On Jan. 13, <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/14/yale-shuts-down-yale-bluebook/">the website was blocked</a> on University servers. Developers and brothers Peter Xu ’14 and Harry Yu ’14 were told that they had made improper use of evaluations and, further, had not been authorized to use the Yale logo.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>Less than a week later, Sean Haufler ’14 <a href="http://haufler.org/2014/01/19/i-hope-i-dont-get-kicked-out-of-yale-for-this/">launched another website</a> designed to replicate the function of YBB+. Written as a Google Chrome extension of Xu and Yu’s creation, the site was met with praise from then-Dean Mary Miller, who called the new site a “good quick fix,” providing identical services without violating Yale’s acceptable use policy. In announcing his site, Haufler indicted the University’s approach, saying IP blocking as a means of censorship was both “unethical” and “futile.” Miller later responded <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/01/22/ybb-closure-prompts-questions-about-data-rules/">in an open letter</a>, saying “we could have been more patient” in dealing with the student developers.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p class='text-muted'>CourseTable, a modified version of YBB+, has not been tampered with since.

His arrest came roughly half a year before the University announced plans to <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/08/21/gourmet-heaven-to-close-in-2015/">terminate the lease</a> on both locations, owned by Yale’s real estate arm, in June 2015. A New Haven Superior Court judge gave Cho <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/12/02/cho-avoids-prison-time/">accelerated rehabilitation</a> in December, binding him to two years of probation but ensuring he will not serve time in jail for his infractions. Similar allegations of wage theft have emerged at other downtown businesses, leveled by the state against <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/03/26/accounts-clash-in-j-b-wage-theft-investigation/">J&B Deli</a> and by employees against the <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/10/06/pinkberry-workers-claim-wage-theft/">now-shuttered Pinkberry</a>, both on Chapel Street.</p>

                                    <p class='text-muted'>And while the University has not indicated what will replace Gourmet Heaven, <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/07/31/international-retailers-to-share-one-broadway-space/">high-end retail</a> is sweeping into empty storefronts <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/11/17/up-to-open-seven-new-businesses/">elsewhere on Broadway</a>.

New starting quarterback <a href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/11/21/roberts-rips-through-playbook/">Morgan Roberts '16</a> set or tied records for passing yards, completion percentage and touchdown passes.

Instead, University President Peter Salovey outlined a series of sustainability initiatives designed to limit Yale’s carbon footprint.
