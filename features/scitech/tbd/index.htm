		Five years after consolidating its public relations team into Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, the explosive growth of that office has some questioning its purpose.

		<big>W</big>hen it became apparent that a cheating investigation was growing too large to hide, University administrators called in the experts&mdash;Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.
		<br /><br />
		With talkative students soon returning to campus, officials had just a few weeks to act if they wanted to control how the world learned of the largest academic integrity case in the school's history. So, in mid-August, leaders from the College, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the University's central administration convened with HPAC, the University's public relations apparatus, to hatch a plan.
		<br /><br />
		They came up with an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem. First, communications staff would craft a story for the Harvard Gazette, the University-run publication, around a letter from FAS Dean Michael D. Smith about the proceedings of the cheating case—a process normally kept entirely secret. And second, HPAC would call reporters, one by one, into University Hall for 30-minute sit-downs with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal to hear the details of the case.
		<br /><br />
		And on Aug. 30, the first day of movein for upperclassmen, HPAC executed the plan, setting off a controlled detonation that would become known as the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
		<br /><br />
		“We needed to start a conversation about this, so we couldn't wait for this conversation to start in a different way or on different terms,” said Christine M. Heenan, vice president for public affairs and communications.
		<br /><br />
		Never consulted in the decision to announce the case publicly was the body who was adjudicating it—the Administrative Board. That the professors atop Harvard's administrative hierarchy turned to seasoned public relations consultants rather than the Ad Board on the decision of if and how to share the news points to the weight that Harvard places on presenting itself to the outside world. As the reach and saturation of the news media have expanded in recent years and the target on Harvard's back has grown, the University has increasingly turned to behind-the-scenes actors whose mission is to streamline information and groom Harvard's image.
		<br /><br />
		While leaders of that effort emphasize accuracy and access as their prime objectives, some say that the rise of HPAC has replaced openness with guardedness and a diverse dialogue with a homogenized message. At Harvard, they worry, the University's intensifying focus on public perception is blurring its vision.

		<h2>HPAC ON THE RECORD</h2>
		
		If HPAC sounds unfamiliar, it might be because it is good at its job. Perched on the top floor of the Holyoke Center, the offices of Harvard Public Affairs and Communications are easy to miss. But from high above Harvard Square, the nearly 60-person team can see all that it speaks for: the Yard, much of Harvard's Cambridge campus, its property in Allston, and even the three floors of the Boston Federal Reserve Building occupied by the Harvard Management Company.
		<br /><br />
		Under one roof, and with one general goal, HPAC's employees are responsible for three main functions—advancing Harvard's interests in government, communicating with the public through the outside media and various digital outlets, and publishing the Gazette, an online and print magazine of Harvardrelated stories written by its own staff. Harvard's government and community relations unit splits its time and attention between Holyoke and anywhere off-campus that Harvard might have interests, from across the river in Allston to Washington, D.C., where staff members lobby lawmakers and several federal agencies on behalf of the University.
		<br /><br />
		But the bulk of HPAC's work on campus is done by molding a message for Harvard to deliver. That means publishing its own stories in the Gazette, promoting content online, and issuing press releases. And by pooling requests from reporters and then reaching out to appropriate administrators or faculty, HPAC consolidates the flow of information in and out of the University.
		<br /><br />
		“What we're supposed to bring to that table is how do we inform the audiences we need to reach in ways that are clear and informative and accurate and as comprehensive as possible,” Heenan said.
		<br /><br />
		HPAC also acts as a hub, providing guidance for Harvard's 12 schools, most of which have their own communications staff of just a few people.
		<br /><br />
		Excluding employees who work in the government and community relations unit, the number of full-time equivalent University employees who work for or service HPAC has grown by more than 60 percent, from more than 31 in December 2008 to 51 today, according to online archives of the communication division website and information provided by HPAC.
		<br /><br />
		That rapid growth is the product of a dramatic shift in strategy and structure that has taken place at Harvard in only the last several years.
		<br /><br />
		In fall 2008, Heenan arrived as the first Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications. A former White House analyst in the Clinton Administration who went on to start her own public relations firms and consult for other Ivy League institutions, Heenan came to Harvard with a wealth of public relations experience.
		<br /><br />
		Following Heenan's arrival, in the 2010-2011 school year a branch of the government and community affairs division of the Office of Government, Community, and Public Affairs was moved from Brattle Street to its new home alongside the Harvard News Office, also part of the OGCPA, in the Holyoke Center, and the newly unified office was named Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.
		<br /><br />
		As communications officers for distinct parts of the University assembled together in Holyoke, spokespeople that once worked with their own standards were brought into line, allowing for a more streamlined message machine. HPAC's growth also included the hiring of staff, who, liked Heenan, possessed long and decorated resumes in public relations, consulting, and government.

		<h2>THE BUREAUCRACY OF SILENCE</h2>

		While communications officers groom University leaders and largely leave faculty members alone, lower-level administrators and staff members are sometimes told by administrators not to have any contact with journalists at all.
		<br /><br />
		Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents several thousand University staff, said that HUCTW members have noticed increasing pressure to avoid speaking with the press.
		<br /><br />
		“In the past few years, it's been a fairly steady drumbeat,” Jaeger said. “There have been emails, there have been statements, there have been conversations or personalized instructions... Our members have been internalizing the general idea that they best say, ‘No comment.’”
		<br /><br />
		These communications are often sent by human resources, rather than the communications office, but they often ask that requests simply be redirected towards a public relations staffer.
		<br /><br />
		Still, Heenan said that she did not think that HPAC maintained any policy on staff communication with the press, and she did not see her office's role as any kind of information barrier at all. In a university community, she said, public relations officers must show restraint out of sensitivity for “the free flow of information, and the freedom of expression, and disparate voices.”
		<br /><br />
		Emails from human resources departments, however, show that administrators sometimes discourage staff members from speaking to the press— and, in some cases, send them in HPAC's direction.
		<br /><br />
		During the manhunt for the Boston Marathon bombing suspect in April, for example, an email from FAS Human Resources sent to all FAS department administrators said, “A reminder that all connections or conversations with the media or any other external third parties regarding this situation must be made through Jeff Neal.”
		<br /><br />
		Neal is HPAC's University Communications Director responsible for FAS. A statement from Kevin Galvin, the senior communications director at HPAC, said that administrators were concerned that the sharing of inaccurate information could put people at risk in a still-fluid situation. When asked about a media policy in FAS Human Resources, Galvin referred that request to Neal, who in turn did not return repeated requests for comment.
		<br /><br />
		In a 2009 email to Lamont Library employees, a library administrator instructed workers to direct media inquires to the Harvard College Communications Office, advising them “to make no comment.” Galvin said that HPAC could not comment on the email, because the Harvard College Library no longer exists after merging into the unified Harvard Library.
		<br /><br />
		In Harvard's Houses, policy for talking to the press varies. Senior Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell said that following a Crimson article about sexual assault in 2010, resident deans were instructed to direct all media inquiries pertaining to College-wide issues to University Hall or HPAC. Van C. Tran, who was a resident tutor in Lowell House from 2005 to 2011, said that when he was at Harvard, tutors were free to talk to the press about day-to-day issues on which they had direct knowledge, but were discouraged from speaking about major University news events.
		<br /><br />
		Yet HPAC's efforts to help shape the message are not just responsive to administrators seeking assistance or to journalists seeking information and sources. Online and in the Gazette, it seeks to produce and disseminate positive content often leave out some of the University's biggest stories.
